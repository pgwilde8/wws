🔹 Common Core Features of the 3 tiers, starter, growth,scale

These should go in a “What’s Included in All Builds” section:

Standard pages (Home, About, Services, Contact, etc.)

Private admin dashboard for the owner (leads, logs, data, etc.)

Lead capture + webhook systems (e.g., Stripe webhook for payments)

Logo + images created via AI

Lead capture + basic backend logic

Ownership of the finished site (you build it, they own it)

That’s already a strong baseline. We’ll phrase that as:

Every build includes a complete lead-ready website with admin dashboard, lead tracking, payment webhook integration, brand assets (AI-generated logo + images), and owner access to backend data.

I reviewed your **“Choose Your Build”** page — here’s a detailed breakdown with suggestions you can use to tighten messaging, improve conversions, and align it with pricing-page best practices.([UserGuiding][1])

---

## 🧠 First Impressions

The **tiered structure** (Starter / Growth / Scale) is on the right track: it helps visitors *self-segment* based on needs and budget. This is something conversion experts recommend for pricing pages — using clear options that match real user needs.([UserGuiding][1])

You also do a great job of framing this as *systems, not just pages*, which reinforces your brand positioning.

---

## ✅ What’s Working Well

### ✔️ Clear Tier Descriptions

Each path has a concise explanation of who it’s for and what it delivers. That helps prospects quickly identify which option fits them.

This mirrors best practices: fewer, clearer plans with obvious differences rather than a long overwhelming list.([UserGuiding][1])

### ✔️ Differentiation by Complexity

The copy clearly frames:

* **Starter** — quick, basic automation
* **Growth** — integrated systems + workflows
* **Scale** — custom engineering

That progression helps avoid confusion for users about what they’re paying for.

---

## 🚀 Opportunities to Improve Conversions

### 1. **Add Feature Comparisons**

Right now visitors have to *read* through text to infer differences. Consider adding a **simple comparison table** showing what’s included in each tier (e.g., pages, automations, CRM, support levels).
Clear comparison tables help prospects scan faster and decide quicker — a big pricing-page best practice.([UserGuiding][1])

Example structure:

| Feature              | Starter | Growth   | Scale  |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| Lead capture system  | ✓       | ✓        | ✓      |
| Automation workflows | Basic   | Advanced | Custom |
| CRM logic & routing  | —       | ✓        | ✓      |
| Custom engineering   | —       | —        | ✓      |

This makes value differences obvious at a glance.

---

### 2. **Highlight the “Best Value”**

You’ve labeled Growth as *Most Popular*, which is great. But you could strengthen it visually — use a highlighted card, accent color, or badge. This is known to *guide choice* and improve conversions.([UserGuiding][1])

---

### 3. **Add Social Proof**

Pricing pages perform better with **testimonials, client logos, or results stats** near the choices. Even one or two short quotes under each plan can increase trust and reduce hesitation.([UserGuiding][1])

Example:

> “Growth launch doubled my leads in 90 days.” — Client Name

---

### 4. **Make CTAs More Actionable**

Right now each tier has a simple “Start …” CTA, which is fine. But consider tailoring them slightly:

* **Starter** → *Start Starter Build*
* **Growth** → *Launch My Growth System*
* **Scale** → *Book a Tailored Strategy Call*

CTAs that reference outcomes (e.g., “Launch”, “Build”, “Scale”) can nudge conversions.

---

### 5. **Add a Mini FAQ or Reassurance**

Pricing pages improve trust when buyers feel *less unsure* — adding a small section like:

**Common Questions Before You Choose**

* *Can I upgrade later?*
* *What support is included?*
* *Do I own everything you build?*

This answers hidden buyer questions and reduces friction.([UserGuiding][1])

---

### 6. **Include a Guarantee or Refund Policy**

If you offer any form of satisfaction guarantee, adding a short line builds confidence. Example:

> “14-Day Satisfaction Guarantee — If it isn’t what you expected, let’s make it right.”

This can dramatically reduce hesitation on a pricing page.([UserGuiding][1])

---

## 🧩 Copy & Messaging Suggestions

### Before the Tier Blocks

Right now the transition from the headline *“Choose Your Build”* to the options is abrupt. You might add a small intro paragraph like:

> “Pick the build that matches where your business is today — from fast setup to fully custom systems. No upsells, just the right depth for your needs.”

This sets expectation and leads into the three tiers.

---

### After the Tier Blocks (Support Section)

The “Support That Keeps the Engine Healthy” section is great — it reassures people that you won’t build it and abandon it. But you could tighten the language and make the bullets more scan-friendly.

Example:

* **24/7 System Monitoring**
* **Automation Stability & Issue Resolution**
* **Platform & Integration Updates**
* **No Charge for Critical Fixes**

Clear bullets like this improve readability.

## What else can be added to Growth tier that makes sense?

✔ No checkout surcharge to Bob’s customers
✔ Margin added later only for new clients and only on payouts or your own invoice

## How this differs from Growth

| Growth                             | Scale                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small business automation          | Large organization orchestration                                 |
| One phone agent + CRM + scheduling | Multiple AI agents + enterprise call trees + audit + routing     |
| Prebuilt workflows                 | Custom backend engineering + AI decision journeys                |
| Scheduling embed                   | Scheduling + agent orchestration + audit + org-level permissions |
| Notifications                      | Full orchestration across chat, SMS, phone, email, admin         |

---

## How to justify the fee for Scale later (pricing-page ready line)

> **“Stripe processes payments for your business. Scale clients hire WebWise to engineer and operate the automation layer on top — multiple AI agents, inbound/outbound phone sales AI, CRM orchestration, scheduling, dashboards, audit logs, and enterprise backend engineering. We integrate, secure, monitor, and automate at scale — you retain ownership, we operate the engine.”**

---

## Scale Plan = Not for Bob’s customers, it’s for Bob *only if Bob becomes a large organization*

Meaning:

* Bob’s **tint shop customers never pay WebWise**
* Bob could pay WebWise later **only if his business grows into an enterprise-level automation need**

---

## You’re not missing anything major now

Your tiers now look complete and clean:

| Tier         | Summary                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard** | Full foundation site + SEO submission + scheduling embed + 1-way SMS owner alerts + OpenAI chatbot             |
| **Growth**   | Standard + inbound/outbound phone sales AI + CRM + multi-step automation                                       |
