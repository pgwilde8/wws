    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 22, 2025</p>

    <div class="important-notice">
        <p><strong>Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using our services.</strong> By accessing or purchasing from WebWise Solutions LLC, you agree to these Terms.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Services Provided</h2>
    <p>WEBWISE SOLUTIONS LLC (“Company”, “we”, “us”) will deliver custom digital business solutions as described on our website and agreed upon at purchase.</p>

    <h2>2. Project Timeline</h2>
    <p>We aim to complete your project in ~21 days after you finish onboarding. The clock starts when you’ve submitted the required onboarding details and assets. If you delay inputs, timelines extend. If we need more time to ensure quality, we’ll continue working until you’re happy, even if it goes past 21 days.</p>

    <h2>3. Satisfaction Guarantee</h2>
    <p>We guarantee to do all we can to make our clients happy. If you are not satisfied, we will continue to revise and improve your project until you are.</p>

    <h2>4. No Refunds</h2>
    <p>Due to the custom nature of our work, all sales are final and non-refundable. However, we guarantee to work diligently until you are happy with your new site.</p>

    <h2>5. Support</h2>
    <p>After payment, you’ll receive secure login access to your dashboard, including a built-in Support Center to submit and track tickets.</p>

    <h2>6. Client Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Clients must provide timely feedback, required information, and approvals. Delays in response may extend the project timeline.</p>
    <div class="important-notice" style="background:#e6f7ff; border-left:4px solid #3498db;">
        <strong>API Credentials & Integrations:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Clients are responsible for providing their own OpenAI API key if they wish to use AI features.</li>
            <li>Clients must provide Twilio account credentials if they want SMS or AI agent calling features (phone/SMS/call automation).</li>
            <li>These credentials must be entered securely in the dashboard after login. We do not supply or manage these third-party keys on your behalf.</li>
            <li>Failure to provide required credentials may limit access to certain features.</li>
        </ul>
        <span style="color:#555; font-size:0.98em;">This ensures your privacy, security, and full control over your integrations.</span>
    </div>

    <h2>6a. Email Handling</h2>
    <p>We do not manage or host your business email. Email accounts and their contents remain your private business information. Forms and leads collected from the site we build (contact, booking, lead capture) are forwarded to the primary email address you provide. If you do not have a business email, we recommend setting one up with Namecheap (which can also provide a low-cost domain). You are responsible for maintaining access to and security of your email accounts.</p>

    <h2>7. Scope of Work</h2>
    <p>The scope of each project is defined at the time of purchase. Additional requests or changes may require a separate agreement and fee.</p>

    <h2>8. Communication</h2>
    <p>We strive for clear, respectful communication. If a client is repeatedly dissatisfied or uncooperative, we may need to extend the timeline or, in rare cases, terminate the agreement. In such cases, at our discretion, we may offer a partial refund based on work hours completed and deliverables provided.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>WEBWISE SOLUTIONS LLC is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Our total liability is limited to the amount paid for services.</p>
    <p>9A. No Financial Advice & Trading Risk Disclosure

        WEBWISE SOLUTIONS LLC is a software provider only. We do not act as a broker, dealer, investment adviser, or financial institution.
        
        Any software tools, automation features, integrations, or informational content provided by the Company are for general informational and technical purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or trading advice.
        
        If the Company provides software that integrates with third-party brokerage platforms or financial APIs, users acknowledge and agree that:
        
        All trading decisions are made solely by the user

        The Company does not hold, manage, or access user funds
        
        The Company does not guarantee profits or trading performance
        
        Trading financial instruments involves substantial risk, including the possible loss of all invested capital. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
        
        By using any trading-related features, the user assumes all responsibility and risk for their trading activity.</p>
